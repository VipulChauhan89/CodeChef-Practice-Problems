/*
  Chef is very hungry. So, Chef goes to a shop selling burgers. The shop has 2 types of burgers:
        Normal burgers, which cost X rupees each
        Premium burgers, which cost Y rupees each (where Y>X)
  Chef has R rupees. Chef wants to buy exactly N burgers. He also wants to maximize the number of premium burgers he buys. 
  Determine the number of burgers of both types Chef must buy. Output âˆ’1 if it is not possible for Chef to buy N burgers.
