/*
    Mario was going to gift Princess Peach a string S of even length N. Mario was clumsy and thus, broke the string in the middle. 
    He now has two strings A and B such that A=S[1,N/2] and B=S[N/2+1,N]. Mario is not sure about the order in which he should join the strings A and B to get the string S. 
    Thus, he joins the strings in any random order. Find whether it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string S if he joins the strings A and B in any order.
    Note that S[L,R] denotes a substring of string S starting at index L and having a length (Râˆ’L+1).
