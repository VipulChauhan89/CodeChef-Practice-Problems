/*
  Chef is playing a variant of Blackjack, where 3 numbers are drawn and each number lies between 1 and 10 (with both 1 and 10inclusive). 
  Chef wins the game when the sum of these 3 numbers is exactly 21.

  Given the first two numbers A and B, that have been drawn by Chef, 
  what should be 3-rd number that should be drawn by the Chef in order to win the game?

  Note that it is possible that Chef cannot win the game, no matter what is the 3-rd number. 
  In such cases, report âˆ’1 as the answer.
