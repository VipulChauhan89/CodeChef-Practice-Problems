/*
  It's the soccer match finals in Chefland and as always it has reached the penalty shotouts. 
  Each team is given 5 shots to make and the team scoring a goal on the maximum number of shots wins the game. 
  If both the teams' scores are equal, then the game is considered a draw and we would have 2 champions.

  Given ten integers A1,A2,â€¦,A10, where the odd indexed integers(A1,A3,A5,A7,A9) represent the outcome of the shots made by team 1 and even indexed integers(A2,A4,A6,A8,A10) represent the outcome of the shots made by team 2(here Ai=1 indicates that it's a goal and Ai=0 indicates a miss), 
 
 Progam to determine the winner or find if the game ends in a draw.
