/*
  Finally, College has started calling students back to campus. 
  There are so many students and thus due to some safety measures the college canâ€™t call back all the students on the same day. 
  It currently has the capacity of screening K students on a single day. There is a total of N students. 
  Program to find the minimum number of days required for all the students to be back on the campus?
