/*
    Chef has recently introduced a feature which allows you to open any userâ€™s submitted code (not just your own), and ask an AI to explain that code in English. For example, you can go to https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/70530506 and click on "Analyse This Code". But there is a restriction that the feature works only on codes which are at most 
    1000 characters long. Given the number of characters, C, in a particular code, output whether the feature is available on this code or not.
