  Chef is a beginner and should ideally try and solve only problems with difficulty rating strictly less than 1000. 
  Given a list of difficulty ratings for problems in the Chefâ€™s to-do list, 
  please help him identify how many of those problems Chef should remove from his to-do list, 
  so that he is only left with problems of difficulty rating less than 1000.
